# Chroma DB with Langchain Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for indexing documents with Langchain Utilities in Chroma DB, retrieving semantically similar documents for a specific query, ensuring persistence in Chroma DB, and integrating Chroma DB with Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5. It also includes functionalities for using Question-Answering Chains to extract answers from documents and utilizing the RetrieverQA Chain.

## Setup
- Mount Google Colab drive for accessing documents.
- Install necessary Python packages: `openai`, `langchain`, `sentence_transformers`, `chromadb`, and `unstructured`.
- Load documents from a specified directory using `DirectoryLoader` from `langchain.document_loaders`.
- Split documents into chunks using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from `langchain`.

## Functionality
- **Embeddings and Chroma DB**: Utilizes Sentence Transformer Embeddings for semantic understanding and creates a Chroma DB instance for storing and retrieving document data.
- **Query and Retrieval**: Includes code for similarity searches in Chroma DB to retrieve documents based on queries.
- **Persistence**: Demonstrates how to persist a Chroma DB instance.
- **LLM Integration**: Integrates GPT-3.5 using `ChatOpenAI` for enhanced question answering and document retrieval.

## Usage
- To use this notebook, first mount your Google Drive and ensure all documents are in the specified directory.
- Run cells sequentially to install required packages, load documents, and process them.
- Use the provided functions and methods to perform document retrieval based on semantic similarity.
- Leverage the integrated GPT-3.5 model for advanced querying and document retrieval.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have the necessary API keys and permissions for using GPT-3.5 and other services.
- This notebook is a base template and might require customization to fit specific use cases, especially in metadata extraction and indexing.
